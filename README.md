# ThrowThatBox

Simple site to configure remainders to throw away boxes that you store in some cabinet just in case you need to return the product.

Add a name, a photo, where did you store the box and a date to remind you and the rest is on us.

Just throw away the box when you receive the remainder email and live a clutter free life.
