# ThrowThatBox

Simple site to configure reminders to throw away boxes that you store in some cabinet just in case you need to return the product.  

Add a name, a photo, where did you store the box and a date to remind you and the rest is on us.  
Just throw away the box when you receive the reminder email and live a clutter free life!

I built this to use it myself, and to refresh my React skills.  
Built with React for the frontend, Supabase for the auth, database and storage, Supabase's Edge Functions to trigger sending emails through Resend and deployed on Netlify.
